```

**Key Features:**
- 100% compliance with footy.yaml schema specifications
- Type-safe interfaces for all 16 FootyStats API endpoints
- Comprehensive analytics types for predictions and statistics
- Request/Response DTOs for all operations
- Backwards compatibility with existing service interfaces

### **2. Cache System (src/cache/)**
```
✅ src/cache/CacheManager.ts       - Full-featured caching system

```

**Key Features:**
- In-memory caching with TTL support
- Tag-based cache invalidation
- Memory management and cleanup
- Statistics tracking (hit rate, memory usage)
- Get-or-set pattern for efficient data retrieval
- Football-specific TTL configurations
- Pattern-based key matching

### **3. Enhanced Constants & Transformers**
```
✅ src/utils/constants/footballConstants.ts  - All 16 API endpoints + cache TTL
✅ src/utils/transformers/FootyStatsTransformer.ts - Data transformation utilities
```

**Key Features:**
- Complete mapping of all FootyStats API endpoints
- Cache TTL strategies for different data types
- Rate limiting configurations
- Data transformation utilities for API responses
- Type-safe constants with proper exports
